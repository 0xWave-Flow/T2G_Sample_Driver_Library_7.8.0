This example can be run on all cores simultaneously.

CM0+ uses 2 sub counters of MCWDT0 and toggles LED0,1 when a fault occurs on upper limit crossing

CM7_0 uses 2 sub counters of MCWDT1 and toggles LED8,9 when a fault occurs on upper limit crossing

CM7_1 uses 2 sub counters of MCWDT2 and toggles LED5,6 when a fault occurs on upper limit crossing
