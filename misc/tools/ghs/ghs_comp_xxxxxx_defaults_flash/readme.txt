The file 'flash_chips_fcr4tcm.odb' contains chip definitions for Cypress FCR4, Traveo and Traveo II MCUs.
It is needed to support GHS flash programming and must be placed in '<Compiler-Directory>\defaults\flash'.
Please make a backup of your local modifications before overwriting the already existing 'flash_chips_fcr4tcm.odb'

Traveo II entries within this file are generated based on the simple 'tvii_chip_list.csv' in the subfolder 'generator'.
In case of missing definitions, the missing chips can be easily added to this file and the generator can be run again.

!!! IMPORTANT: Please do not manually edit 'flash_chips_fcr4tcm.odb' as your changes will get overwritten when the generator is started !!!
